# MoneyTrackerPrototype
A expense tracker application that makes it easier to pay everyone back at the end of the trip.
It uses the MVC, Factory, Observer, Facade and Singleton design pattern. 
The application consists of two databases where one stores the users and the others stores the expenses, a GUI that the user interacts with and a ExpenseManager class that handles the interaction on the GUI.
The GUI consists of various panels for each such as the addition and removal of users, the addition and removal of expenses and the displaying of the debts. This is done using a CardLayout.
The ExpenseManager class consists of classes that add and remove users and expenses and calculate the debts of each users using the minimal transactions.
